# Instructions
In this folder, you may see the demo.

To start with, switch to a `python3.7` environment.

Then install `pip install opencv-python configparser requests`

1. write a configuration file `demo.ini` like the following

```
[DEFAULT]
address = http://localhost:8501
source = ${PATH_TO_YOUR_VIDEO}

[vehicle]
input_width = 416
input_height = 416
score_thresh = 0.5
iou_thresh = 0.5
max_outputs = 32
categories = car,bus,truck

[plate]
score_thresh = 0.2
iou_thresh = 0.5
max_outputs = 1
width = 240
height = 80

[ocr]
score_thresh = 0.5
iou_thresh = 0.5
max_outputs = 8
alpha = 5
names_file = ../../data/ocr/ocr-net.names
prior_csv = ../../prior.csv
```
**NOTE**: the *optional* `prior_csv` file has the same number of lines as the `names_file`, and the same number of columns equals to the `max_outputs`. This file can be generated by the `plate_knowledge.py` script given the annotation in `.json` file. The `names_file` is a product of the `gen_networks.sh` script in the project's root directory.

2. launch the demo with `python demo.py`
**NOTE**: we also use the `plate_knowledge.py` file in the `demo.py`. Before, we run the demo, please execute this in this folder:
`ln -s ../plate_knowledge.py plate_knowledge.py`
